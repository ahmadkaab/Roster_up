The module was automatically converted to an EcmaScript module, but that is in conflict with the specified module format. Either change the "type" field in the package.json or replace EcmaScript import/export syntax with CommonJs syntas in the source file.
In some cases EcmaScript import/export syntax is added by an transform and isn't actually part of the source code. In these cases revisit transformation options to inject the correct syntax.

You're importing a component that needs `usePathname`. This React Hook only works in a Client Component. To fix, mark the file (or its parent) with the `"use client"` directive.

The module was automatically converted to an EcmaScript module, but that is in conflict with the specified module format. Either change the "type" field in the package.json or replace EcmaScript import/export syntax with CommonJs syntas in the source file.
In some cases EcmaScript import/export syntax is added by an transform and isn't actually part of the source code. In these cases revisit transformation options to inject the correct syntax.

- A server/client branch `if (typeof window !== 'undefined')`.
- Variable input such as `Date.now()` or `Math.random()` which changes each time it's called.
- Date formatting in a user's locale which doesn't match the server.
- External changing data without sending a snapshot of it along with the HTML.
- Invalid HTML tag nesting.

It can also happen if the client has a browser extension installed which messes with the HTML before React loaded.

[00:12:30.222] Browser ERROR   A tree hydrated but some attributes of the server rendered HTML didn't match the client properties. This won't be patched up. This can happen if a SSR-ed Client Component used:

- A server/client branch `if (typeof window !== 'undefined')`.
- Variable input such as `Date.now()` or `Math.random()` which changes each time it's called.
- Date formatting in a user's locale which doesn't match the server.
- External changing data without sending a snapshot of it along with the HTML.
- Invalid HTML tag nesting.

It can also happen if the client has a browser extension installed which messes with the HTML before React loaded.
